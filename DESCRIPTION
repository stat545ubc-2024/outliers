Description: The outliers package provides a function, check_outliers(), to detect and return outliers in numeric vectors. It supports two commonly used methods: Z-score, which identifies data points that deviate significantly from the mean, and the Interquartile Range (IQR), which finds extreme values based on quartiles. The package offers flexibility to customize thresholds for both methods, customize the quantile algorithm type for the IQR method, and automatically handles missing values.
